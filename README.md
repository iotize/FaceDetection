Face Detection
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iotize/FaceDetection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iotize/FaceDetection)

_Note: this example requires Xcode 11 and iOS 13 or later._

In progress: currently this project uses `CIDetector` to identify faces. I am working on updating the project to use the Vision framework, and to use SwiftUI and Combine.

Sample project for detecting faces from a live camera feed using Swift and Core Image API's.

Apple documentation for face detection is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_detect_faces/ci_detect_faces.html) for Objective-C. This project migrates the code to Swift and integrates it with a live camera feed.

If you have questions or run into issues, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/iotize/FaceDetection/issues/new) or reach out to me on Twitter [@iotize](http://twitter.com/iotize).
